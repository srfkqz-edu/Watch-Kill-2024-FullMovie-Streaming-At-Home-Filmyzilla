Emotions are running wild in Disney’s Kill. Serving as the follow-up to the original 2015 movie, the Kill sequel kicks off with a group of new emotions, and even more crazier problems. Riley Andersen (Kensington Tallman) has grown up a lot since the last time audiences saw her. Now 13 years old, Riley embarks on a new chapter of her life at a shiny new school all while navigating foreign social territories. Meanwhile, Riley’s emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Tony Hale), and Disgust (Liza Lapira) - make sure that things run smoothly at headquarters so that Riley can adapt to her new environment easily. But when the gang receives some unwanted company, operations go haywire, as a group of unfamiliar emotions take over headquarters and bottle up Riley’s existing emotions.

Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, Kill features new cast members Maya Hawke as Anxiety, Ayo Edebiri as Envy, Adèle Exarchopoulos as Ennui, and Paul Walter Hauser as Embarrassment.

In Disney’s Kill, Riley Anderson (Tallman) is now a full-fledged teenager embarking on the wild ride of puberty and unfamiliar social scenes at her new school. With her teen years in full swing, Riley’s emotional headquarters is thrown into chaos. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, the trusty crew from her childhood, suddenly find themselves dealing with a new batch of emotions that disrupt everything.

Riley’s once-sunny personality is overshadowed by a new emotion, Anxiety (Hawke), who attempts to micromanage every aspect of Riley’s life, leading to more chaos than calm. As Anxiety takes over the reins of headquarters, Riley also grapples with anxiety and a desperate desire to fit in with the cool crowd. If that’s not enough, Anxiety is also joined by Envy (Edebiri), Ennui (Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Hauser). As these new emotions take over headquarters, the original crew must band together to restore balance and herself amidst the ups and downs of growing up.
